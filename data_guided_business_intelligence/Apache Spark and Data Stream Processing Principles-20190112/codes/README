#----------------SparkSQL----------------

1. All the datasets used came along with the Spark installation. So, no external data sets are required.

2. Please use Python REPL to execute the code.

3. You can use the examples from the slides or from the file: SparkSQL.py, after the spark cluster is setup
(using "./bin/pyspark" from the Spark installation directory).
